# Agent-Elimination-in-Multi-Agent-Reinforcement-Learning
Honours research project investigating whether agent elimination mechanisms can improve cooperation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning environments. Built a custom Unity environment with configurable elimination rules, testing how agents balance self-interest against collective benefit in resource-sharing dilemmas.
